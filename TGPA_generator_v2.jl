'triangle generalized_preferential_attachment_graph'
===========================================
Generate an instance of a triangle generalized preferential attachment graph which
follows the Eikmeier, Gleich description. This is an undirected graph
that is generated as follows:
- Start with an empty graph
- Add n vertices where at each time step one of three events occurs:
A new node is added with probability p, along with two edges to existing nodes;
Three new nodes with two edges between them is added with probability 1 - p
Every m steps, coalesce the nodes added in time step 1

Functions
---------
The following functions are synonyms
- 'triangle_generalized_preferential_attachment_graph_v2'
- 'tgpa_graph_v2'
and
- 'triangle_generalized_preferential_attachment_edges_v2!'
- 'tgpa_edges_v2!'
The computational functions are
- 'tgpa_graph_v2(n,p,k0,m)' Generate a TGPA graph with n total nodes.
    This returns a MatrixNetwork type. Note that this process allows self loops.
The edge functions are
-   'tgpa_edges_v2!(n,p,m,edges,n0)' Add new edges to an existing set, by taking
    n0 time steps. Edges are added in one of two ways: From a new node to
    an existing node with probability p, between three new nodes with probability 1-p

Input
-----
- 'n': the number of nodes in the final graph.
- 'p': The probability of a node event, p must be a constant.
- 'k0': The number of nodes in the starting clique.
- 'm': The frequency of combining nodes
- 'edges': A list of edges to be manipulated in the process of generating
          new edges.
Output
------
- A matrix network type for the triangle generalized preferential attachment graph.
- 'edges': An updated list of edges.
